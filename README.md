# MiB

Group project by three students during the course Object Oriented Programming with Java. The database script and InfDB.jar was provided by the professor. The system is developed in Java with Swing and in the IDE NetBeans, using MySQL for the database. The commits made give a hint as to who did what, but of course we collaborated a lot.

The purpose of this system is to help agents in the organisation MiB to keep track of all agents and their equipment, and log information about the aliens that come to visit Earth. The system can also be used by the aliens to find information about their visit.
